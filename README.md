This project uses various machine learning models in order to predict merge conflicts in version control systems (like Git) based on commit and pull request metadata.

## ðŸ“ˆ Project Overview

- Load and clean a **real-world merge conflict dataset**.
- **Feature engineer** new ratios based on developer activities.
- **Feature selection** using:
  - Correlation analysis
  - Random Forest importance
- Train and evaluate three models:
  - **Decision Tree**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **Naive Bayes**
- Use **GridSearchCV** to optimize hyperparameters.
- Save best models to **pickle** files.
- Measure performance using:
  - **Confusion Matrix**
  - **Classification Report**
  - **Precision-Recall Curve (PRC) and PR-AUC**

## ðŸ“Š Model Summary

| Model           | F1 Score | PR-AUC | Notes |
|-----------------|----------|--------|-------|
| Decision Tree   | 0.65 â†’ (after features) 0.65+ | 0.6782+ | Good interpretability, controlled depth |
| Random Forest   | 0.62 â†’ (after features) 0.63+ | 0.7410 | Most robust |
| Naive Bayes     | 0.42 â†’ (after features) 0.45  | 0.4930 | Struggles with complex patterns |

âœ… Adding features like `commit ratio` and `added/deleted lines ratio` improved model performance!
